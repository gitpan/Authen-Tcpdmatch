Revision history for Perl extension Authen::Tcpdmatch.

0.04  Sun Sep 25 23:07:51 2005
       - Disabled yapp parser and yapp tests. They will come back when 
	 Parse::Flex is updated.
       - Packaging changes to keep CPANTS happy.
       - Now, also builds with Module::Build.

0.03  Sun Oct 12 02:47:44 2003
       - Added a Yapp parser with a Parse::Lex lexer .
       - The Yapp parser is several times faster than P::RD and
	  used by default;  P::RD is still available.
       - Since the Yapp parser can only detect (but not rsync)  wrong 
	 syntax in hosts.*, I removed test cases with illegal syntax.
       - A simple benchmark is now available (in ./scripts/ directory) .
