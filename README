Authen/Tcpdmatch version 0.01
=============================


This module implements the core functionality of tcpdmatch: it consults hosts.allow
and hosts.deny to decide if service should be granted. 

Due to its tiny size, approx. 2k bytes, this module is best suited for 
embedded environments.  Although it is not a full-feature re-implementation 
of tcpdmatch(1), I hope it will still do most of what you want. In particular, 
it supports the following capabilities:

 A. ALL and LOCAL wildcards.
 B. Recursive EXCEPT  modifier
 C. Leading and trailing dot patterns
 D. Net masks
 E. Skipping of lines with faulty syntax, comments, or blanks

It does not support shell commands,  client lookups, endpoint patterns, spoofing attacks,
and expansions. If these features are important to you,
perhaps you should consider using libwarp.so and Authen::Libwrap .

 There are two parsers that do the same thing. One first parser is based on 
RecDescent, and the other is based on Yapp . THe Yapp parses is several times
faster and is used by default. None of these parsers are re-entrant; although,
with a tiny effort (15 minutes) the Yapp-based parser could easily become 
re-entrant -- I chose not to implement this on purpose: I would rather have less 
words in the code since I don't care about being re-entrant.
