Authen/Tcpdmatch version 0.01
=============================


This module implements the core functionality of tcpdmatch: it consults hosts.allow
and hosts.deny to decide if service should be granted. 

Due to its tiny size, approx. 2k bytes, this module is best suited for 
embedded environments.  Although it is not a full-feature re-implementation 
of tcpdmatch(1), I hope it will still do most of what you want. In particular, 
it supports the following capabilities:

 A. ALL and LOCAL wildcards.
 B. Recursive EXCEPT  modifier
 C. Leading and trailing dot patterns
 D. Net masks
 E. Skipping of lines with faulty syntax, comments, or blanks

It does not support shell commands,  client lookups, endpoint patterns, spooofing attacks,
and expansions. If these features are important to you,
perhaps you should consider using libwarp.so and Authen::Libwrap .
